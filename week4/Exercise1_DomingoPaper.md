# Exercise 1: Domingo Paper
## 1 What is the meaning of generalization in the paper?
"Generalization" means in machine learning that is generalized by means of exemplary training data. The most important point is that the data is always divided into test and training data.

## 2 What are the many faces of overfitting?
Overfitting happens, for example, if the correct classifier has not been selected. Then there is the possibility that classifiers (or parts of them) are just being hallucinated and that they do not correspond to reality or are simply randomly encoded.

## 3 What is feature engineering?
"Feature engineering" is the process of getting the raw data into a suitable form to construct features from it.  Here, intuition, creativity and "black art" are usually just as important as the technical stuff. 

## 4 What is ensemble learning?
"Ensemble Learning" means combining different variants of learners for better results. And not that different variants of learners are tested and only the best one is selected.

## 5 Why does more data beats clever algorithms?
The fastest way to success is often to just get more data. You should first use simple learner before you turn on complex learner where you need a lot of knowledge to achieve good results.
